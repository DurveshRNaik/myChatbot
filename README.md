# My-AI-Chatbot (React JS + Tailwind CSS + Google Gemini API)

This repository holds the code for a step-by-step series on building a modern and responsive AI chatbot application. This project is built using **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, leveraging the powerful API of the **Google Gemini AI Tool**.

The tool functions similarly to AI models like ChatGPT or DeepSeek, answering user queries and maintaining their search history.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Interactive Chat Interface:** User-friendly and fast chat experience.
* **Gemini API Integration:** Utilizes the Google Gemini AI tool for accurate and relevant answers.
* **Search History Management:** Ability to view and delete previous conversations.
* **Responsive Design:** Uses Tailwind CSS to look great on all devices.
* **Code Snippet Handling:** Proper formatting and copy functionality for code in the output.
* **Dark Theme Option:** A crucial part of styling (to be added later in the series).
* **React Local Storage:** Used for managing search history on the client side.
